Machine Learning Project based on Optical Character Recognition<br>
The data set contains 5000 handwritten digits where there are 500 digits for every type of digit. Each digit is of 20Ã—20 pixel dimensions. We will split the data such that 250 digits are for training and 250 digits are for testing for every class.<br>
